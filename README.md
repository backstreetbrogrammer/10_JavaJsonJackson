# Java, JSON and Jackson

> JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values). It is a common data format with diverse uses in electronic data interchange, including that of web applications with servers.

JSON is a language-independent data format. It was derived from JavaScript, but many modern programming languages
include code to generate and parse JSON-format data. JSON filenames use the extension .json. Any valid JSON file is a
valid JavaScript (.js) file, even though it makes no changes to a web page on its own.

> Jackson is a high-performance JSON processor for Java which provides several ways to work with JSON.
